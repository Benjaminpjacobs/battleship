# Battleship

Everyone's favorite childhood game is back in full on REPL glory! Built out of pure ruby, battleship has three levels to choose from and a talking computer opponent.

To play first [install ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) if not already installed.

Then clone down the branch. Enter the following:

``` ruby
cd battleship
ruby lib/battleship.rb
```
and you're ready to sink some ship!
